1.0.0
-----
* Update to omniauth 2.0.4 and add rack protection authenticity token
  * All forms will need an authenticity_token param added like in the login view
  * Refactored the provided routes to be simpler. Now only login and logout (no more install)
  * shopify_webhook now defines the route because it needs to also configure ignoring csrf for the route
  * refactored other internal methods to simplify and reduce surface area
* Removed heroku rake tasks. They are out of date and don't encourage best practises

0.12.0
------
* Update to use the Shopify AppBridge instead of the ESDK
  * This change is mostly to generated files so you'll need to apply those updates
    to your own versions.
* shop_origin no longer includes protocol
* return_to re-worked to function with the AppBridge

0.11.0
------
* remove rack-flash3 use sinatra-flash instead

0.8.0

* Shopify updated the way sessions are created: https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_api/blob/master/README.md#-breaking-change-notice-for-version-700-, updating code to reflect these changes.

0.7.0
-----
* make base_url private (users can add back in their app easily if needed)
* store request params in the session so they can be retrieved after the omniauth flow. This fixes app actions from the admin if the user's session has expired

0.2.0
-----
* added a SHOPIFY_REDIRECT_URI env param for setting the redirect_uri (was breifly HOSTNAME)
* add versions to gemfile
* refactored the generator
* Changed install method to after_shopify_auth. Implementations of this method must now be idempotent as this will be called anytime the app is auth'd which may be due to just a lost session and not necessarily an install.
* Always redo the full auth rather than trying to keep track of first time install state vs re-auth
