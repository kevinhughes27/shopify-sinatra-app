0.7.0

* make base_url private (users can add back in their app easily if needed)

* refactored some smaller methods to make the shopify_session method easier on the eyes.

-----
* remove current_shop* methods in favor of yielding shop_name to the block methods

0.5.0
-----
* replace webhook_session and webhook_job with shopify_webhook
* remove redis and resque as dependencies

0.4.0

0.3.0

0.2.0
-----
* added a SHOPIFY_REDIRECT_URI env param for setting the redirect_uri (was breifly HOSTNAME)
* add versions to gemfile
* refactored the generator
* Changed install method to after_shopify_auth. Implementations of this method must now be idempotent as this will be called anytime the app is auth'd which may be due to just a lost session and not necessarily an install.
* Always redo the full auth rather than trying to keep track of first time install state vs re-auth
