0.7.0

* Changed install method to after_shopify_auth. Implementations of this method must now be idempotent as this will be called anytime the app is auth'd which may be due to just a lost session and not necessarily an install.
* Always redo the full auth rather than trying to keep track of first time install state vs re-auth
